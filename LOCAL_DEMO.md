# ITS — Local Demo Guide

How to run the Internship Tracking System on a single machine and walk through
**every** feature. Written for **Windows 11 + PowerShell** (the machine this was
prepared on), with macOS/Linux notes where they differ.

> TL;DR: start PostgreSQL → create `backend/.env` → `prisma migrate dev` + seed →
> run backend on **:3001** and frontend on **:3000** → log in as
> `ceng_chair@example.com` / `password123`.

---

## 0. What you're running

| Piece | Tech | URL |
|-------|------|-----|
| Backend API | Node + Express + Prisma | http://localhost:3001 |
| Frontend | React (Create React App dev server) | http://localhost:3000 |
| Database | PostgreSQL 18 | localhost:5432 |

The frontend defaults to `http://localhost:3001/api`, so the backend **must** run
on port 3001. (`npm start` ignores `frontend-new/.env.production`, which only
applies to production builds — so local runs always hit localhost.)

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Already installed on this machine — verify with:

```powershell
node --version    # v22.x  (need v16+)
npm --version     # 10.x
```

PostgreSQL 18 is installed at `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18`. `psql` is **not**
on the PATH, but you don't need it — Prisma talks to the DB directly via
`DATABASE_URL`. If you want the `psql` CLI anyway, add
`C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\18\bin` to your PATH.

Dependencies are already installed (`node_modules` present in both `backend/` and
`frontend-new/`). If they ever go missing:

```powershell
cd c:\dev\ITS\backend ; npm install
cd c:\dev\ITS\frontend-new ; npm install
```

---

## 2. Start PostgreSQL

The Windows service `postgresql-x64-18` ships **stopped**. Start it from an
**Administrator** PowerShell (right-click PowerShell → *Run as administrator*):

```powershell
net start postgresql-x64-18
```

Or: press `Win+R` → `services.msc` → find **postgresql-x64-18** → **Start**
(optionally set *Startup type* to *Automatic* so it comes up on boot).

Confirm it's listening:

```powershell
Get-Service postgresql-x64-18    # Status should be "Running"
```

> **macOS:** `brew services start postgresql@16`  •  **Linux:** `sudo service postgresql start`

---

## 3. Configure the backend `.env`

There is no `.env` yet (it's git-ignored). Create one from the template:

```powershell
cd c:\dev\ITS\backend
copy .env.example .env
```

Open `backend/.env` and set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL **superuser
password** (the one you chose when installing PostgreSQL 18). The default
superuser is `postgres`:

```env
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:YOUR_PASSWORD@localhost:5432/internship_db?schema=public"

JWT_SECRET=any_long_random_string_at_least_32_characters_long
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Leave email blank for the demo — the password-reset code prints to the backend console.
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=
```

Notes:
- The database `internship_db` does **not** need to exist yet — `prisma migrate dev`
  creates it for you (the `postgres` superuser has permission to).
- If your password contains URL-special characters (`@ : / ?`), URL-encode them
  (e.g. `@` → `%40`).

---

## 4. Initialize the database

From `backend/`:

```powershell
npx prisma generate          # build the Prisma client
npx prisma migrate dev       # creates internship_db + all tables
npm run prisma:seed          # loads demo data (users, departments, students, internships)
```

Seeding loads: 3 roles, 22 departments, admin/chair/member users, 12 students
across 3 engineering departments, 2 terms, 7 companies, and a spread of
internships in every lifecycle state.

Want a visual DB browser during the demo? `npx prisma studio` → http://localhost:5555.

---

## 5. Start the backend

```powershell
cd c:\dev\ITS\backend
npm run dev
```

You should see:

```
✓ Database connected
✓ Server running on http://localhost:3001
```

If you instead get `✗ Could not connect to the database`, PostgreSQL isn't
running or `DATABASE_URL` is wrong — revisit steps 2–3.

---

## 6. Start the frontend (second terminal)

```powershell
cd c:\dev\ITS\frontend-new
npm start
```

It opens http://localhost:3000 automatically.

---

## 7. Demo login accounts

**Every seeded account's password is `password123`.**

| Role | Email | What they can do |
|------|-------|------------------|
| General Admin | `admin1@example.com` | Assign commission chairs, view commission status |
| Commission Chair (Computer Eng.) | `ceng_chair@example.com` | Everything below + manage members |
| Commission Member (Computer Eng.) | `ceng_member1@example.com` | Students, grading, early eval, reports |

Other seeded staff (all `password123`): `eeng_chair@example.com`,
`meng_chair@example.com`, `ceng_member2@example.com`, `admin2@example.com`, etc.

> Computer Engineering is the richest department to demo: it has 4 students with
> internships in various states, a chair, and 2 members.

---

## 8. Full showcase script

A ~10-minute path that touches every feature. Keep the **backend terminal
visible** — one step reads a code from it.

### Act 1 — Admin (`admin1@example.com`)

1. **Log in** as the admin → lands on the Admin dashboard.
2. **Komisyon Durumu Görüntüle** (sidebar): shows every department with its chair
   and up to two members. Point out CENG/EENG/MENG are staffed.
3. **Komisyon Başkanı Atama**: pick a department with **no** chair yet (e.g.
   *Mimarlık* or *Biyomühendislik*), fill İsim / Soyisim / E-posta / **Geçici
   Şifre** (e.g. `temp123`), and **Başkanı Kaydet**. The new chair appears in the
   "Mevcut Komisyon" panel on the right.
   - *Note:* assigning a chair to a department that already has one **replaces**
     the existing chair — so avoid CENG/EENG/MENG here, or you'll change the demo
     logins.
3b. (Optional) Click **Sil** next to that chair to show removal.

### Act 2 — First-login password change (ties Admin → Auth together)

4. **Log out** (top-right Çıkış). Log in as the chair you just created, using the
   temporary password. Because app-created accounts are flagged
   `requiresPasswordChange`, you're forced onto the **Şifre Değiştirme** screen.
5. Enter the temporary password + a new one (≥6 chars) → you're redirected into
   the Chair dashboard. (This account is now a normal login.)

### Act 3 — Commission Chair (`ceng_chair@example.com`)

6. **Log out** and log in as `ceng_chair@example.com` / `password123`.
7. **Öğrenci Listesi**: select the **2025 Summer Internship Term**. You'll see the
   CENG students, their current/previous internship, dates, and an S/U/– grade
   badge. Try the **Puana Göre Filtrele** and **Staj Tipi** filters. Rows with
   dates outside the term are highlighted red.
8. **Staj Puanlandır**: the default filter is *Puanlanmamış* (ungraded). For the
   Summer term you'll see ungraded internships (e.g. Ayşe Kaya, Fatma Demir, Ali
   Veli's STAJ2). Set a grade **S/U** and an optional note for one or two, then
   **Tüm Notları Kaydet**. They disappear from the ungraded list (now graded).
9. **Erken Değerlendirme**: select one or more students with the checkboxes →
   **Erken Değerlendir** → fill grade + reason in the modal → **Değerlendirme
   Tutanağı Oluştur**. A `.docx` evaluation record downloads automatically. Open
   it to show the formatted GTU report (header, commission names, student table).
10. **Öğrenci Listesi → Komisyon Değerlendirme Tutanağı Oluştur**: generates a
    `.docx` for the whole filtered list. *Heads-up:* each internship is marked
    "reported" once included, so a second identical report says "nothing left to
    report" — that's expected. Re-seed (step 9 below) to reset.
11. **Komisyon Üyesi Ekleme**: CENG already has its **max of 2** members, so
    adding a third shows the "already 2 members" guard (a feature). To demo a
    successful add, **Sil** one member first, then add a new one (İsim / Soyisim /
    E-posta / Geçici Şifre).
12. **Staj PDF Yükleme**: select a term, then choose a GTU internship-form PDF
    (*staj fişi*). The backend parses name, student number, company, contact,
    dates and STAJ type into an editable review form. **Any PDF works for the
    demo** — fields the parser can't read show as blank/"NOT FOUND" and you can
    type them in before saving. Click **Tümünü Onayla ve Kaydet** to create the
    internship.
    - **Business rule to show:** set Staj Tipi to **Zorunlu Staj 2** for a brand-new
      student number → save → the backend rejects it ("must complete/pass STAJ1
      first"). Switch to **Staj 1** and it saves.

### Act 4 — Commission Member (`ceng_member1@example.com`)

13. **Log out** → log in as a member. Same dashboard minus *Komisyon Üyesi Ekleme*.
    Members can view students, grade, early-evaluate, and generate reports — show
    one of those to prove role-scoped access.

### Act 5 — Forgot-password flow (no email needed)

14. **Log out** → **Şifremi unuttum** on the login page.
15. Step 1: enter a seeded email (e.g. `ceng_member2@example.com`) → **Kod Gönder**.
16. **Switch to the backend terminal** and read the line:
    `[DEV ONLY] Password Reset Code for ...: 123456`.
17. Step 2: type that 6-digit code → Step 3: set a new password → you're bounced
    to login. Sign in with the new password to confirm.

That covers: role-based dashboards, admin commission management, forced password
change, student listing/filtering, grading (single + bulk), early evaluation,
Word-report generation, PDF parsing + the STAJ1→STAJ2 rule, member scoping, and
the full password-reset flow.

---

## 9. Reset / re-seed between demos

Reports flip internships to "reported" and grading mutates state, so to get a
clean slate:

```powershell
cd c:\dev\ITS\backend
npx prisma migrate reset    # drops everything, re-applies migrations, re-runs the seed
```

(One command — it re-seeds automatically. Answer "y" when prompted.)

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Backend prints `✗ Could not connect to the database` | PostgreSQL service not running (step 2) or wrong password in `DATABASE_URL`. |
| `net start` → "Access is denied" | You're not in an **Administrator** PowerShell. |
| `PrismaConfigEnvError: Missing ... DATABASE_URL` | `backend/.env` missing or `DATABASE_URL` not set (step 3). |
| Frontend loads but every request fails | Backend isn't running, or it's not on port **3001**. |
| Port 3001 already in use | `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` then `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`. |
| Login fails for a seeded user | DB wasn't seeded — run `npm run prisma:seed`. All seeded passwords are `password123`. |
| "Bu bölümde zaten 2 komisyon üyesi var" | Expected — CENG starts full. Remove a member first. |
| Report says nothing to report | Those internships were already reported; re-seed (step 9). |
